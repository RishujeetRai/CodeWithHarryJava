        // Collections in Java are available as Classes and Interfaces
        // Few commonly used Collections are:
        // ArrayList --> For variable size Collection
        // Set --> For distinct Collection
        // Stack --> For LIFO data structure
        // HashMap --> For storing key-value pairs

        // Collection class is available in Java.util package in Java
        // Collection class also provides us with static methods for searching, sorting etc.
